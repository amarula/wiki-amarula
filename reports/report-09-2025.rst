**Michael Trimarchi**: In the past month, Michael Trimarchi made
significant contributions to the software development. They updated the
documentation in the README.md file to reflect a change in the pdf
report format, now stored within a zip file for large reports requiring
multiple files. Additionally, they modified the mend.bbclass to utilize
an async API for generating reports when the WS_ENABLE_PDF_REPORT
variable is enabled. This change ensures that the report is prepared for
download and delivered as a zip file instead of a standalone pdf. These
updates enhance the efficiency and usability of the software for
generating and handling reports, demonstrating Michael Trimarchi’s
commitment to improving functionality and user experience.
