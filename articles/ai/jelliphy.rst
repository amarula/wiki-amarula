Jelliphy is a no-code framework that lets you build web applications entirely in your browser. By integrating directly
with Git repositories, it supports the full development lifecycle. When you make visual edits to your appâ€™s interface,
those adjustments are translated into requests sent to ChatGPT, which generates the necessary code patches that Jelliphy
then applies automatically to your Git project.
