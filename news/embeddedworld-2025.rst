Amarula Solutions presented a demo showcasing a smart thermostat powered by a combination of cutting-edge technologies: Yocto, Zephyr, Flutter, and LVGL. This demo highlights their expertise in developing embedded systems with modern Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) on ST platforms, utilizing the latest Long Term Support (LTS) Board Support Packages (BSPs).

**Featured Devices**

The demo utilizes two ST boards:

* **STM32MP257 Board:** This board runs a Flutter application on a Linux BSP built with the latest Yocto LTS release (Scarthgap).
* **STM32F429I-DISC1 Board:** This board reads humidity, pressure, and temperature sensors via I2C and runs a GUI powered by LVGL on Zephyr OS (4.0.0).

**Seamless Communication & Smart Functionality**

The two boards communicate via CAN, creating a prototype of a smart thermostat with integrated weather station functionality. Sensor data is displayed on both GUIs. The system is designed for dynamic adjustments to heating, cooling, or ventilation based on real-time data.  The Flutter application also integrates a real-time weather forecast page using OpenWeatherMap.
