Enhancing RX/TX Statistics in Linux CAN Drivers
===============================================

We are pleased to announce that a patch series authored by Dario Binacchi, embedded Linux and kernel engineer at `Amarula Solutions <https://www.amarulasolutions.com>`_, has been accepted into the Linux kernel.
The series addresses inaccuracies in the RX (receive) and TX (transmit) statistics counters across multiple CAN drivers,
ensuring proper functionality and reliability in these critical metrics.

The changes enhance the robustness and reliability of the Linux kernel, particularly in industrial, automotive, and
embedded applications, where precise error counter management is crucial for monitoring and diagnostics.

The series [1] will be included in the Linux kernel 6.13 release.
